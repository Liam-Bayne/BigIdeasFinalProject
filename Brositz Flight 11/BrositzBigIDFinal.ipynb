    "The Best Neighborhood: Apply the metric from the previous section to determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Beyond just executing code, provide a narrative about why you think this is the best neighborhood. Incorporate a data visualization, perhaps to rank all of the neighborhoods or show a neighborhood’s best-ness over time. The key is to make a data driven argument\n",

    "This project is meant to explain which neighborhood is the best in the City of Pittsburgh. We want to examine the overall quality of life in each neighborhood. We will be examining health, safety, education and food. We believe these qualities of life are the most important. We also considered things such as transportation like public transportation of buses, but believed that it was not quite as significant as our other sub metrics. Green spaces such as parks was also considered for happiness and health, but we decided to put that under the sub realm of health which will be examining trees that would be in green spaces.*\r\n",
